## A9: Product

A website for participating in live auctions of car models. You can choose from different scales, brands and colours. A user can create its auctions, bid and comment on other userâ€™s ones, and search through all the available models. Besides this, it is also possible to add a given seller or auction to their favourites, as well as to manage their profile page, edit their information or check their statistics. The user is informed about all the main events of the website through notifications. The administrators of the system can promote a user to admin statute, ban users and schedule/cancel auctions.

### 3. Application Help

The website has several ways to help the user, from tooltips and default values/tips in input fields to a textual description of some fields.
For example, on the search page, every search option is followed by an explication.

In the auction cards presented on the search page, each value presented is associated with a representative icon and a small description when in hover.

The user also receives feedback messages for every important action done. For instance, a red warning shows every time a user tries to bid in an auction whose highest bid is already of their authorship. In the next image, we can see the message shown on the profile page if the user is banned.

### 4. Input Validation

Every input is validated, not only on HTML but also on the server-side. For example, when a user tries to bid in an auction, the input is validated to warrant that its value is higher than the value of the last bid.

While logging in, the user inputs are also verified, and a red warning shows up if the credentials don't match the database records.

If the user tries to bid with a value that is higher than the BuyNow value, a message is also shown to inform him the action will end the auction with a final value equal to the BuyNow defined.
