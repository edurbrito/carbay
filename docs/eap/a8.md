# A8: Vertical Prototype

The prototype developed in this artefact includes the implementation of some user stories to validate the architecture defined and learn the usage of the technologies required by this project. It includes the implementation of pages of visualization and the possibility to interact with some functionalities. Besides this, the access control of the website pages is also implemented, along with a presentation of the error and success messages.
